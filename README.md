> **Sign2Sound** is an integrated communication system that bridges the gap between static fingerspelling and fluent digital conversation. Unlike standard recognition models, we utilize **Geometric Feature Extraction** and **Predictive Text Intelligence** to deliver zero-latency, high-precision translation without the need for heavy GPUs.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Geometric Vision Core
We moved away from raw coordinate-based recognition. Our system calculates **63-dimensional geometric feature vectors** (joint angles, surface normals, and relative distances).
* **Rotation Invariant:** Recognition holds stable even if the wrist rotates.
* **Scale Invariant:** Works across varying hand sizes and distances.

### 2. Intelligent Prediction Engine
Fingerspelling every letter is slow. Our **N-Gram Context Engine** accelerates communication by:
* **Autocompleting words** after just 1-3 letters.
* **Predicting the next word** based on sentence context (e.g., *"WE"* → suggests *"ARE"*).
* **Adaptive Memory:** The system learns from user habits over time.

### 3. Remote Broadcasting ("The Studio")
We solved the visibility problem. The signer does not need to show their laptop screen to the audience.
* **Real-Time Sync:** Text is pushed to a Supabase cloud database in <50ms.
* **PWA Receiver:** Any external device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) can scan a QR code to view and listen to the live transcript instantly. The best part? **No signup or installation required!**

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Webcam (Built-in or USB)
- Active Internet connection (for Broadcasting features)

### Step 1: Clone & Install Dependencies

```
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/basil-saji/sign2sound_zora.git](https://github.com/basil-saji/sign2sound_zora.git)
cd sign2sound_zora

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Step 2: Initialize Predictive Memory

Before running the system for the first time, you must initialize the predictive engine's vocabulary database. This script loads the N-Gram weights.

```
python training/vocab_trainer.py
```

Output should confirm: `"SUCCESS! Memory updated."`

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

### 1. Launch the System

Run the main inference engine from the root directory:

**Bash**

```bash
python inference/main.py
```

### 2. The Interface

* **Main Window:** Shows your camera feed with the "Studio Dark" UI.
* **Broadcast Window:** A second window will pop up displaying a QR Code.
* **Action:** Scan this with your phone to see the live text appear on your mobile device.

### 3. How to Communicate

The system uses a Hybrid Input Method:

* **Spell:** Sign letters (A-Z). The system smooths jitter and locks onto letters.
* **Confirm (Thumb Up):** Locks in the currently spelled word.
* **Smart Select (Rock On 🤘):** Selects the AI-Predicted Word shown in green.
* **Clear (Thumb Down):** Deletes the last word or clears the buffer.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

* **Accuracy:** 98.0% (Weighted F1-Score on IEEE Test Set).
* **Inference Speed:** 18ms per frame (approx. 55 FPS on i5 CPU).
* **Robustness:** Maintained >90% accuracy with ±30° hand rotation.

See results/confusion_matrix.png for a detailed per-class breakdown.
